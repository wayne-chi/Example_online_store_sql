# Example_online_store_sql
Modeled an online book store and documented in Word file. 

In this project, the database of a hypothetical online Bookstore called "BookMart" is modeled.
The data is in a normalized form.

It contains various tables and the Er diagram is in the photos above.

The project had been done long before uploading here on github so not all the sql files could be recovered.
However, all explanations and codes are presented in the word document.

Code is in oracle_ sql
